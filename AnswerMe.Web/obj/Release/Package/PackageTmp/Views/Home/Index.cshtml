                AnswerMe is project developed by Anthony Sicignano and Ginu Kuncheria.  The app allows students a simple and quick method of submitting questions they may not wish to voice aloud.  AnswerMe allows
                students to submit these questions via text or the web.  These questions are displayed real-time, allowing the presenter to answer them during the course of the presentation.
